          <h2>A Classic Series for the Modern Day</h2>
            <p>Half Life Alyx brings back the classic game series with its newest edition to the story of Half-Life. Starring Alyx Vance, the daughter of scientist Eli Vance, from Half-Life 2, is the main protaganist and is wandering through the combine-controlled city with a twist. The entire game is in VR, with high performance graphics, photorealistic settings and graphics, and, to quote many players, "Looks better than real life."</p>

          <h2>Too Much Horror</h2>
            <p>As one would expect, having frightening moments and stressful situations in video games through VR, amplifies their effects by a large portion. Valve encountered an issue when developing Half-Life Alyx, that issue, funnily enough, was that the game was too scary for playtesters. The players literally did not want to play any more of the game as they were too frightened of the environment and enemies. Therefore, Valve had to dial back the horror elements of their game by a noticeable portion. However, they were still able to keep in several frightening and stressful situations in the finished product, if not dialed back from one of the original versions. </p>

          <h2>Community Modding</h2>
            <p>Just like with all their other games in the past, Valve made Half-Life Alyx highly moddable by providing the consumer with modding tools and equipment, custom-built to work not only with their newest iteration of the Source Engine, Source 2, but also custom-built for their flagship VR game, Half-Life Alyx. The community page already features over a thousand different community-made mods, modes, and maps built for Half-Life Alyx.</p>
